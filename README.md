# Haysquest
A text based dungeon crawler made for my APCS A class. Closely follows the [tutorial by Trystan](http://trystans.blogspot.com/2016/01/roguelike-tutorial-00-table-of-contents.html) for making a dungeon crawler. 

**This was mainly made to test out the gradle building system.**

## Prerequisites

- This game runs off of [AsciiPanel](https://github.com/trystan/AsciiPanel) Download library and add it to project using your IDE accordingly. 
- I used Eclipse to build this project, copy the files into your workfolder and run it through the IDE. Not sure if it works with other IDE's.
